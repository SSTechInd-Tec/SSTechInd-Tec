## Bio
With over 4 years of experience in Python and JavaScript development, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, honing my skills and contributing to the ever-evolving tech landscape. I specialize in web development using Django and Flask in Python and a little Node.js from JavaSript, and for desktop applications, I utilize Qt and PyQt. In addition to my language expertise, I'm well-versed in tools like Linux and Docker, and I have experience working with databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Oracle. In the Java realm, I specialize in GUI development using Swing and AWT. I'm always excited about new challenges and enjoy crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. Feel free to explore my repositories to see my coding adventures and projects!
